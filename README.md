# Next Starter

A simple Next.js 13 starter created from [shadcn/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-template). It includes shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, stateless Magic Link authentication, and more.

The authentication is handeled trough [Iron Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session) and does not require a database. It sends a magic link to the user's email address. The link contains a token that is used to authenticate the user.
